# Introduction

**Artificial intelligence (AI)** is a thriving field with many practical applications and active research topics. We look to intelligent software to **automate routine labor, 
understand speech or images, make diagnoses in medicine and support basic scientific research.**

**In the early days of artificial intelligence**, the field rapidly tackled and solved problems that are intellectually diﬃcult for human beings but relatively straight-forward 
for computers—problems that can be described by a list of formal, mathematical rules.

The **true challenge to artificial intelligence** proved to be solving the tasks that are easy for people to perform but hard for people to describe formally — problems that 
we solve intuitively, that feel automatic, like recognizing spoken words or faces in images.

The solution to above challenge is: 

* to allow computers to learn from experience and understand the world in terms of a hierarchy of concepts, with each concept defined in terms of its relation to simpler concepts.
* By gathering knowledge from experience, this approach avoids the need for human operators to formally specify all of the knowledge that the computer needs.
* The hierarchy of concepts allows the computer to learn complicated concepts by building them out of simpler ones.
* If we draw a graph showing how these concepts are built on top of each other, the graph is deep, with many layers. For this reason, **we call this approach to AI deep learning.**
